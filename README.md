## Introduction
-The primary goal of this project is to demonstrate the effective use of Firebase for authentication,data management, and media storage.

- Like/Dislike: Users can like or dislike tweets in real time.
- Responsive UI: Integrated with Tailwind CSS for a clean, mobile-friendly design.
- Realtime updates: All tweet interactions and updates are reflected instantly via Firebase Firestore.

- Error Handling: User-friendly interface for handling incorrect login attempts or invalid inputs.
